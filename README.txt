WELCOME TO THE SIMPLE CALCULATOR

INSTRUCTIONS;
DOWNLOAD AND OPEN THE "Calculator.exe" file.
WRITE A STATEMENT FOLLOWED BY A SEMICOLON THEN 'ENTER' TO PRINT THE RESULT. 
ENTER 'Q;' TO QUIT THE PROGRAM.
ENTER 'VAR;' TO SEE THE LIST OF VARIABLES STORED IN THE CALCULATOR.
ENTER 'LET' FOLLOWED BY [VARIABLE_NAME] '=' [EXPRESSION] TO STORE A NEW VARIABLE.
ENTER 'SET' FOLLOWED BY [VARIABLE_NAME] '=' [EXPRESSION] TO CHANGE AN EXISTING VARIABLE NAME'S VALUE.

NOTES;
> THE CALCULATOR CAN HANDLE STATEMENTS WITH
	ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, DIVISION, MULTIPLICATION AND REMAINDER EXPRESSIONS

> THE CALCULATOR IS NOT STANDARD, IT DOES NOT STORE INTERIM RESULTS FOR CALCULATION.
	IT IS SCIENTIFIC, IT READS THE ENTIRE STATEMENT AND THEN EVALUATES MULTIPLICATION AND DIVSION FIRST. 

> ONLY THE FOLLOWING NON-LETTER CHARACTERS ARE ACCEPTED;        
							 EXAMPLES OF SYNTAX:
         =    EQUALS		                         LET x = 100*34;   SET x = 300;
         (    OPEN PARENTHESIS                           (100+25);
         )    CLOSE PARENTHESIS                          SAME AS ABOVE
         +    ADD                                        1+1;
         -    SUBTRACT                                   100-82;
         *    MULTIPLY                                   64*7;
         /    DIVIDE                                     100/4;
         %    REMAINDER                                  200%8;
         .    DOT (USED FOR FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS)      0.56+23;

> ANY EXTRA INPUT AFTER A SEMICOLON WILL BE IGNORED.
> NEW DECLARED VARIABLES MUST START WITH A LOWERCASE LETTER AND CONTAIN ONLY LOWERCASE LETTERS AND DIGITS
> A CALCULATION CANNOT BEGIN WITH A VARIABLE NAME
> A VARIABLE NAME CAN HOWEVER BE USED TO BEGIN AN EXPRESSION WHEN DECLARING THE VALUE OF A NEW VARIABLE. Eg LET x = pi*6;
> USING NON-PRINTABLE ASCII CHARACTERS IN CALCULATIONS WILL CRASH THE PROGRAM! DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING BEFORE A SEMICOLON;

ERROR MESSAGES - 
(MOST ARE SELF EXPLANATORY BUT ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ARE MADE TO CLARIFY SOME ERRORS)

> "BAD TOKEN!"- THIS RESULTS FROM USING A CHARACTER THAT IS NOT PROGRAMMED TO BE USED
> "INVALID FIRST TOKEN" - THE CHARACTER YOU ENTERED IS VALID BUT CANNOT BE USED TO START A CALCULATION
> "EXPECTED 'Q', 'VAR;', 'LET' OR 'SET' IF STARTING WITH A LETTER CHARACTER"
> "EXPECTED 'Q', 'VAR;', 'LET' OR 'SET' IF STARTING WITH A LETTER CHARACTER. (ALSO THIS NAME WOULD BE ILLEGAL)"
> "INVALID EXPRESSION" OCCURS WHEN YOU HAVE WRITTEN A VALID EXPRESSION BUT INVALID CHARACTERS ARE DETECTED POST FIX
> "EXPECTED ')'" OCCURS WHEN YOU HAVE NOT CLOSED YOUR PARENTHESIS
> "EXPECTED PRIMARY OR A VARIABLE NAME". A TOKEN IS DETECTED THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EITHER A NUMBER, ( + - OR A NAME
> "DECLARED NAMES MUST START WITH A LOWERCASE LETTER AND CONTAIN ONLY LOWERCASE LETTERS AND DIGITS"
> "EXPECTED '=' AFTER VARIABLE NAME"
> "DIVIDE BY ZERO" - YOU CANNOT DIVIDE BY 0
> "THE VARIABLE NAME YOU ARE TRYING TO USE IS UNDECLARED"
> "DECLARED TWICE". YOU CANNOT STORE TWO VARIABLES WITH THE SAME NAME
> "YOU CANNOT SET A NEW VALUE FOR AN UNDECLARED VARIABLE"
> "VARIABLE VALUE EXPECTED ')'".
> "VARIABLE VALUE BAD TOKEN!" 
> "VARIABLE VALUE INVALID FIRST TOKEN!"
> "VARIABLE VALUE IS AN INVALID EXPRESSION"
> "VARIABLE VALUE EXPECTED PRIMARY OR A VARIABLE NAME"
> "VARIABLE VALUE CANNOT CONTAIN ILLEGAL NAMES"
> "THE NAME YOU ARE TRYING TO USE IN YOUR VARIABLE VALUE IS UNDECLARED"
